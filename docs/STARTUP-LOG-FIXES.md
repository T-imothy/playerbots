# Startup and log rotation repairs

## Logging

- Restrict the implicit Performance.log default to world-server configurations. The authentication server no longer opens the world's performance log merely because it uses the shared logger.
- Close existing streams before reinitializing the logger. The realmd constructor plus explicit initialization otherwise leaked file handles.
- Register the world-server fallback performance stream for rotation, as with explicitly configured logs.
- Preserve append logging when an external handle blocks rename. Retry the affected file after 60 seconds, allowing other logs to rotate normally.
- Handle an empty LogsDir correctly during runtime archive retention.

The earlier runtime-rotation change exposed the shared-file and initialization problems. These errors do not indicate that cleanup deleted the log directory.

## Object-location startup

- Load vmaps from DataDir/vmaps, matching the native CMaNGOS loader contract. The prior bot helper passed DataDir itself and could repeatedly attempt nonexistent map-tree files. Handle the loader result explicitly.
- Index creature, gameobject and pool event membership once after database loading. Preserve the previous first-match order, signed event IDs and current event-activation checks. No event spawn or encounter mechanics are changed.
- Report object-location progress and separate event-check and terrain-area timings.

The vmap helper and repeated event-list scans predate the latest PvP audit. They are verified defects/costs in the reported startup path; the full wall-clock slowdown cannot be attributed solely to a recent audit commit from the available logs.

## Validation and deployment

Production-body tests cover real Windows sharing violations, continued writes, per-file backoff, recovery, repeated initialization, archive retention, signed event membership, missing entries, duplicates, rebuilding, vmap directory/result handling and spawn filtering.

A local benchmark using exported production spawn/event IDs produced identical membership answers for 113,886 Classic, 181,118 TBC and 258,372 Wrath spawns. Event-list scan times were approximately 0.83/2.78/5.20 seconds; index construction plus lookup took approximately 0.002/0.003/0.004 seconds. These are local lookup timings, not production startup-time measurements.

Deploy matching mangosd.exe/PDB and realmd.exe/PDB. Restart both authentication and world processes to release the old authentication process's log handles. No database migration or configuration change is required; existing append, daily/size rotation and retention settings remain in effect. Production startup timings must be checked after the restart.
